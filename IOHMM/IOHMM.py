'''
This module implements IOHMM models:

(1) UnSupervisedIOHMM:
    Standard IOHMM with no ground truth label of hidden states.

(2) SemiSupervisedIOHMM:
    With a little ground truth labels of hidden states, use these labels to
    direct the learning process during EM.

(3) SupervisedIOHMM:
    With some ground truth labels of hidden states,
    use only ground truth labels to train. There are no iterations of EM.

The structure of the code is inspired by
depmixS4: An R Package for Hidden Markov Models:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/depmixS4/vignettes/depmixS4.pdf

Features:
1. Can take a list of dataframes each representing a sequence.
2. Forward Backward algorithm fully vectorized.
3. Support json-serialization of the model so that model can be saved and loaded easily.

                         In this case, should we add some random posterior probability to it,
                         so as to start the EM iterations?

                         For UnsupervisedIOHMM and SemiSupervisedIOHMM this is set to True,

                         For SupervisedIOHMM, this is set to False,
                         since we only want to use labeled data for training.
